<h4>Improving indoor navigation through cluttered rooms using movability estimation</h4>
<h5>By Joris Weeda</h5>
<b>Abstract:</b> Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) poses a challenge for traditional path-planning methods when obstacles block the path, requiring push actions to reach the goal. 
We propose a framework that enables movability-aware planning to overcome this challenge without relying on explicit obstacle placement.
Our framework integrates a global Semantic Visibility Graph and a local Model Predictive Path Integral (SVG-MPPI) approach to efficiently sample rollouts, taking into account the continuous range of obstacle movability. A physics engine is adopted to simulate the interaction result of the rollouts with the environment, and generate trajectories that minimize contact force.
In qualitative and quantitative experiments, SVG-MPPI outperforms the existing paradigm that uses only binary movability for planning, achieving higher success rates with reduced cumulative contact forces.
%This work represents a significant advancement in NAMO planning, offering a robust solution for navigating complex environments with movable obstacles.

<h4>Motion planning for mobile manipulators in multi-agent settings using MPC</h4>
<h5>By Danning Zhao</h5>
<b>Abstract: </b>Mobile manipulators, which integrate a robotic arm on a mobile base, are increasingly being explored and deployed in sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and aerospace. 
While motion planning for these systems has been studied in single-agent scenarios, the use of multiple robots to enhance efficiency and accelerate task completion in multi-agent settings remains largely unexplored, particularly in real-world environments. 
Extending motion planning to multi-mobile manipulators introduces challenges in real-time performance, collision avoidance, and coordination. 
To address these, this thesis proposes a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework with a double integrator as dynamic model, denoted as MPC-d, 
tailored for multi-mobile manipulators operating in shared workspaces. It integrates optimization-based planning with robust state estimation, ensuring effective collision avoidance. 
Furthermore, a prioritized heuristic is introduced, leveraging the prediction horizon of MPC to resolve potential livelocks. 
The framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments. Simulations compare MPC-d with MPC using a triple-integrator model (MPC-t) and a state-of-the-art geometric planner, called Geometric Fabrics (GF). 
Results demonstrate that MPC-d achieves comparable task success rates and collision avoidance compared to GF in pick-and-place scenarios while requiring less computation time than MPC-t. 
Real-world experiments confirm the framework's viability, showcasing effective collision avoidance, enhanced efficiency from the prioritized heuristic, and consistency with simulation outcomes. 
Although MPC-d incurs higher computational costs than reactive geometric methods, it provides reliable performance and motion prediction of other agents in multi-agent settings.
