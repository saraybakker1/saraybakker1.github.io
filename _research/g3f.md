description: "Globally-Guided Geometric Fabrics (G3F) is a framework for real-time motion generation along the full task horizon, by interleaving an optimization-based planner with a fast reactive geometric motion planner, called Geometric Fabrics (GF). The approach adapts the path and explores a multitude of acceptable target poses, while accounting for collision avoidance and the robot's physical constraints."

<!-- ## Abstract
In this paper, we address the problem of real-time motion planning for multiple robotic manipulators that operate in close proximity. We build upon the concept of dynamic fabrics and extend them to multi-robot systems, referred to as Multi-Robot Dynamic Fabrics (MRDF). This geometric method enables a very high planning frequency for high-dimensional systems at the expense of being reactive and prone to deadlocks. To detect and resolve deadlocks, we propose Rollout Fabrics where MRDF are forward simulated in a decentralized manner. We validate the methods in simulated close-proximity pick-and-place scenarios with multiple manipulators, showing high success rates and real-time performance.  -->
