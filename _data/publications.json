The proposed framework includes the design of performance metrics as well as the representation of user inputs for simulation-based optimization. The framework is applied to the optimization of a shared controller for an Image Guided Therapy robot. VR-based user experiments confirm the increase in performance of the automatically tuned MPC shared controller with respect to a hand-tuned baseline version as well as its generalization ability."

We build upon the concept of dynamic fabrics and extend them to multi-robot systems, referred to as Multi-Robot Dynamic Fabrics (MRDF). This geometric method enables a very high planning frequency for high-dimensional systems at the expense of being reactive and prone to deadlocks. To detect and resolve deadlocks, we propose Rollout Fabrics where MRDF are forward simulated in a decentralized manner. We validate the methods in simulated close-proximity pick-and-place scenarios with multiple manipulators, showing high-success rates and real-time performance."

In this work, we address this issue by combining real-time grasp planning with geometric motion planning for decentralized multi-agent systems, referred to as Reactive Grasp Fabrics (RGF). We optimize the precomputed grasp pose candidate to account for obstacles and the robot's kinematics. By leveraging a reactive geometric motion planner, specifically geometric fabrics, the grasp optimization problem can be simplified, resulting in a fast, adaptive framework that can resolve deadlock situations in pick-and-place tasks. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach by controlling a mobile manipulator in both simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic environments."

            poses a challenge for traditional path-planning methods when
            obstacles block the path, requiring push actions to reach
            the goal. We propose a framework that enables movability-
            aware planning to overcome this challenge without relying on
            explicit obstacle placement. Our framework integrates a global
            Semantic Visibility Graph and a local Model Predictive Path
            Integral (SVG-MPPI) approach to efficiently sample rollouts,
            taking into account the continuous range of obstacle movability.
            A physics engine is adopted to simulate the interaction result
            of the rollouts with the environment, and generate trajectories
            that minimize contact force. In qualitative and quantitative
            experiments, SVG-MPPI outperforms the existing paradigm
            that uses only binary movability for planning, achieving higher
            success rates with reduced cumulative contact forces. "

        While global planning methods are effective at considering the full task scope, they lack the computational efficiency required for reactive adaptation. 
        In contrast, local planning approaches can be executed online but are limited by their inability to account for the full task's duration. 
        To tackle this, we propose Globally-Guided Geometric Fabrics (G3F), a framework for real-time motion generation along the full task horizon, by interleaving an optimization-based planner with a fast reactive geometric motion planner, called geometric fabrics. 
        The approach adapts the path and explores alternative target poses, while accounting for collision avoidance and the robot's physical constraints. This results in a real-time adaptive framework considering whole-body motions, where a robot operates in close proximity to other robots and humans. 
        We validate our approach through various simulations and real-world experiments on mobile manipulators in multi-agent settings, achieving improved success rates compared to vanilla geometric fabrics, prioritized rollout fabrics and model predictive control. "
